Q) Create an index as below, and see the time taken to create the index:
     create index i1 on takes(id, semester, year);
 Similarly see how long it takes to drop the above index using:
     drop index i1;

Solution:
We use the '\timing' functionality to enable timing. "explain analyze" doesnt work on the create index command;

=# \timing

=# create index i1 on takes(id, semester, year);
CREATE INDEX
Time: 67.070 ms

=#DROP INDEX
Time: 2.525 ms
