// In this lab you will be implementing Quick Sort and understanding various aspects of its performance
// Sorting will be in increasing order

/*
(1) Implement the quick sort algorithm for an array of double values
    (a) with pivot always as first element of array (QSP1: Quick Sort with 1st element as Pivot)
    (b) with pivot as a randomly chosen element of array (QSRP: Quick Sort with Random Pivot)
(2) Also implement the bubble sort algorithm for sorting (BuSo: Bubble Sort)
(3) Implement logic to generate
    (a) a random array,
    (b) almost sorted array: about 10% of the elements are out of order
    (c) reverse of almost sorted array (almost sorted in decreasing order)
(4) Measure the performance of each algorithm QSP1, QSRP, BuSo, with increasing array size; measure for each kind of input
(5) Use 3 different metrics: number of array element comparisons (double comparisons), number of array element swaps, runtime in seconds

So in your final analysis you have 3 algorithms x 3 inputs x 3 metrics, each of which you will have a plot. Show them all suitably: you can combine meaningful plots into the same graph. You may also show n^2 and nlog(n) in each graph, for comparison.

Submit the graphs along with your code.
